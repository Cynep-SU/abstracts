Have you been in the Kolpino? Difinitely not, but I live here. Boring old buildings, gloomy passers and nothing more you can see here. 
I could say it, but I won't. 
There is also have something good. About this I am telling for you. One of the most beautiful places is the embankment of the Izhora river.
Also you can a take a walk of the fields and enjoy nature. 

If you want more intertaiment, you can absolutely free work in the Izhora Factory. Or go to the shopping, luckily, there are plenty of shops here.

One of the most points of interesting is great prison Crosses.

As you can understand, this is a beautiful city that everyone should come to.
